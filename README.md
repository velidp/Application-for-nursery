## Built With



* [Java](www.java.com) - Programming language
* [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io) - Set of graphics and media packages
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) - Simple mechanism for adding style
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) - Unit testing framework for the Java programming language

The application was developed in the Intellij IDEA development environment. The JavaFX builder scene was used to create and develop the graphical user interface. All data is stored in a relational SQL database. All data entry fields have been validated. If the user enters invalid data, the field for entering this data turns pink, in case the data is valid, the field becomes green. Among other things, CSS was used for validation. The application was tested using the Junit unit for testing the Java programming language. Test coverage is above 60%.
